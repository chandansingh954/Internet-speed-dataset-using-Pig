                                            Internet Speed Datasets:



Problem Statement 1:Number of users of each operator:

a = load 'myspeed.csv' using PigStorage(',');
b = foreach a generate (chararray)$0 as operator,(chararray)$2 as testtype;
c = filter b by testtype == '"download"';
d = group c by operator;
e = foreach d generate group,COUNT(c.operator);
result = order e by $1 DESC;




Problem Statement 2:operator with diffrent technologies:

a = load 'myspeed.csv' using PigStorage(',');
b = foreach a generate (chararray)$0 as operator,(chararray)$1 as technology;
result = DISTINCT b;



Problem Statement 3:Number of users in each area:

a = load 'myspeed.csv' using PigStorage(',');
b = foreach a generate (chararray)$0 as operator,(chararray)$2 as testtype,(chararray)$5 as Lservicearea;
c = filter b by testtype == '"download"';
d = group c by Lservicearea;
e = foreach d generate group , COUNT(c.Lservicearea);
result = order e by $1 DESC; 




Problem Statement 4: Operator with the highiest download speed:

a = load 'myspeed.csv' using PigStorage(',');
b = foreach a generate (chararray)$0 as operator,(chararray)$2 as testtype,(int)$3 as speed,(chararray)$5 as Lservicearea;
c = filter b by testtype == '"download"';
d = order c by $2 DESC;
result = limit d 1;
